# Agent Notes

- Run unit tests with `npm test` (includes the Puppeteer smoke test using a local Chromium and `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`).
- Run linting with `npm run lint` (ESLint with Prettier compatibility).
- The project uses Vitest for unit testing; Puppeteer relies on a system Chromium/Chrome available at `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable` by default.
