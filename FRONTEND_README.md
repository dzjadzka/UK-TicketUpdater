# Frontend status

The repository does **not** ship a working web UI. The `frontend/` folder only contains a Vite/React scaffold that hasn't been wired to the backend or built out beyond the template stage.

The previous document describing a full-featured interface is kept for historical context at `legacy/FRONTEND_README_ARCHIVED.md` and should be treated as an archived concept, not an implemented flow.

For the current state of the project, refer to the main `README.md`, which documents the supported CLI and API usage.
