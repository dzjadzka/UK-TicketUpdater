The previous "Frontend Improvement Plan" outlined a prospective UI that has not been implemented. That planning note now lives at `legacy/FRONTEND_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_ARCHIVED.md` for historical reference only.

If a new UI effort starts, prefer drafting a fresh plan that reflects the current backend capabilities and avoids implying existing flows.
