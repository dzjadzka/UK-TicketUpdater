## Analysis

### No Truly "Hanging" Workflows Found

All 16 workflow runs have completed their execution or are currently running normally:
- 10 workflows completed successfully
- 4 workflows were cancelled (likely by user action)
- 1 workflow is currently in progress (this one)
- 0 workflows are stuck in queued or hanging state

### Possible Interpretation

The reference to "16 подвисшими workflow" (16 hanging workflows) might have been:
1. A misunderstanding about workflow states
2. Referring to the accumulation of many workflow runs over time
3. An issue that has since been resolved
4. Cancelled workflows that appeared to be "stuck" but were actually terminated cleanly

## Recommendations

1. **No Action Required**: All workflows have completed or been properly cancelled
2. **Workflow Cleanup**: GitHub Actions automatically manages workflow run history
3. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor future workflow runs for actual hanging issues
4. **Documentation**: This analysis serves as documentation of the workflow state

## Conclusion

There are no hanging or stuck workflows in the repository. All 16 Copilot workflow runs have either completed successfully, been cancelled, or are currently running normally.
